							<p>BlackRock has implemented certain restrictions associated with specific account types.
								For example, on retirement accounts with BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company
								coded as the custodian, you may only request exchanges. If you wish to make a
								contribution or request a distribution from such retirement accounts, you must contact
								the Fund's transfer agent, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. For retail
								(non-retirement) accounts, you may purchase shares only if you have banking instructions
								on file. We will automatically debit your designated bank account for settlement.
								Redemption orders will be accepted only on accounts with the telephone redemption
								privilege. Proceeds on redemptions will be mailed in the form of a check to the address
								of record unless banking instructions have been established on your account. If you
								would like to add banking instructions to your retail account, please contact Customer
								Service at (800) 441-7762 for assistance. Any transaction conducted using the On-line
								Services will be posted to your account at 4:00 PM EST and the price used to value the
								shares is the net asset value next determined after the transaction has been completed.
								Please note a redemption request cannot exceed $25,000 per account per day for retail
								accounts and $100,000 per account per day for 529 accounts.</p>
							<p>
								1. Internet Services. This Agreement ("Agreement") between BlackRock Funds (the "Fund")
								and myself sets forth the terms on which I am permitted to use the On-line Services. The
								words "I", "my" and "me" in this Agreement mean each person who has an interest in the
								Fund account which is accessible through the On-line Services and any person authorized
								to have such access. On-line Services, for purposes of this Agreement, include the
								on-line services currently offered and which may be offered in the future by the Fund
								for mutual fund transactions and account inquiry, and any other on-line system made
								available to the Fund shareholders by the Fund or its agents or service providers. The
								On-line Services permit me to transmit electronically requests to buy, redeem and
								exchange shares of the Fund. These services are available for use with compatible
								computers with modems that can connect to the Internet. <br> 2. Agreement Governs. I
								will use the On-line Services only on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The terms
								of my Fund account application and the applicable prospectus govern my account. Those
								terms are deemed to be part of this Agreement. <br> 3. Sole User. I will be the only
								authorized user of the On-line Services under this Agreement and I will not make the
								On-line Services available to anyone else. I will keep my security code(s) and other
								security information (all such codes and information, "security information")
								confidential. I will be solely responsible for all requests for transactions and
								information (and the use of the information) transmitted through the On-line Services
								using my security information. The Fund is not obligated to inquire as to the authority
								or accuracy of my instructions transmitted through the On-line Services and will be
								entitled to act upon my instructions; and the Fund will not be liable for any loss,
								expense or other liability arising out of my instructions transmitted through the
								On-line Services. Telephone calls to the Fund may be recorded, and I consent to that
								recording. <br> 4. Duty to Monitor Account. I understand that requests for transactions,
								rather than orders, are transmitted through the On-line Services. I understand that the
								on-line acknowledgments or other messages that appear on my screen for transactions
								entered do not mean that transactions have been received, accepted or rejected by the
								Fund. These acknowledgements are only an indication that the transactional information
								entered by me has either been transmitted to the Fund, or that it cannot be transmitted.
								The Fund will not be deemed to have received or accepted any transaction request I
								transmit through the On-line Services until the Fund has provided me a written
								confirmation. All transaction requests will be deemed to have been made in the form
								received by the Fund. I am responsible for verifying the accuracy and receipt of all
								information transmitted via the On-line Services and for immediately notifying the
								Fund's transfer agent, BNY Mellon, of any errors or inaccuracies relating to information
								transmitted via the On-line Services. I am responsible for monitoring my account. I will
								immediately notify the Fund if: <br> a. a request for a transaction has been placed
								through the On-line Services and I have not received a reference number reflecting the
								request; <br> b. a request for a transaction has been placed through the On-line
								Services and I have not received an accurate written confirmation of the transaction
								within seven (7) business days; <br> c. I have received confirmation of a transaction
								which I did not request or any other report conflicting with information about my
								account; <br> d. there is unauthorized use, loss or theft of any of my security
								information; <br> e. there is a discrepancy between any transaction I requested and the
								information reflected in a confirmation or account statement. <br> If I do not notify
								the Fund when any of the foregoing conditions occur, neither the Fund nor any of its
								employees, agents, affiliates nor any third parties, will be liable to me for the
								handling or loss of any transaction request. <br> 5. My Obligations. I agree to use an
								Internet browser and Internet service provider that support Secure Sockets Layer,
								128-bit encryption and to follow the Fund's logon procedures for On-line Services. If I
								experience any problems using the Internet or reaching the On-line Services, I agree to
								use alternate methods (such as telephone, mail or fax machine) to communicate with the
								Fund and its agents. I agree to be bound by any consents or acknowledgments on which I
								"clicked" while using the Web sites involved in the On-line Services. I will not use the
								On-line Services for any purpose that is unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing,
								libelous, defamatory or obscene. <br> 6. Limitations of Liability. If I do not notify
								the Fund or BNY Mellon promptly of discrepancies as required under this Agreement,
								neither the Fund nor its agents will have any responsibility or liability to me or any
								person whose claim arises through me for any claims with respect to the occurrence I
								failed to report. I understand that the Fund and BNY Mellon reserve the right to
								evaluate my objection to a transaction. <br> I agree that neither the Fund, BNY Mellon
								nor any other Fund agent shall be liable for any losses resulting from technical
								problems, including but not limited to, failure or malfunction of electronic or
								mechanical equipment, communication lines, telephone or other interconnect problems (for
								example, if I am unable to access my online service provider), unauthorized access,
								theft, operator errors, strikes or labor problems or other occurrences beyond its
								control. <br> The Fund will not be liable for interception of information transmitted
								via the Internet nor responsible for access to, or the speed or availability of, the
								Internet or the On-line Services. In addition, neither the Fund, BNY Mellon nor any
								other Fund agent shall be liable for losses caused directly or indirectly by government
								restriction, exchange or market rulings, suspension of trading, war, earthquakes or any
								other conditions beyond the control of the Fund, BNY Mellon or other Fund agent,
								respectively. <br> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
								the maximum liability of the Fund or its agents arising out of any kind of legal claim
								(whether in contract, tort or otherwise) in any way connected with the On-line Services
								shall not exceed $500 in the aggregate. <br> 7. Information from Outside Sources. The
								Fund will not be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information
								provided by outside sources through the On-line Services. My transmissions through the
								On-line Services are at my sole risk. Nothing in this Agreement or the On-line Services
								shall be interpreted as a solicitation, recommendation, endorsement or offer to buy or
								sell securities or other financial instruments nor should it be construed as legal, tax,
								investment, financial or other advice. The fund has no responsibility or liability
								regarding the content or use of sites that the On-line Service may provide links to.
								<br> 8. Outside Services. My Internet service provider may charge me for time spent on
								line. I will be responsible for all expenses that I (or any person using my security
								information or equipment) incur in connection with using the On-line Services. I agree
								that the Fund is not responsible for notifying me of any upgrades or enhancements to
								"browser" software. There are no assurances that the On-line Services will be available
								at all times and the Fund shall have no liability to me for any unavailability of the
								On-line Services. <br> 9. Account Application and Prospectus. The terms of my Fund
								account application and the applicable prospectus govern my account. Those terms are
								deemed to be part of this Agreement. I understand that the Fund is available only to
								U.S. investors, and shares of certain investment portfolios may not be offered and sold
								in all states. Reference to a fund or security anywhere in this Agreement or the On-line
								Services is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold that or any other security. I am
								responsible for reviewing all mutual fund account information viewed on this site in
								order to verify the accuracy of such information and all transactions entered through
								this site. I am also responsible for promptly notifying the Fund of any errors or
								inaccuracies relating to information contained in, or omitted from my mutual fund
								account information, including errors or inaccuracies arising from the transactions
								conducted through this site. <br> TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ALL REQUIREMENTS,
								RESTRICTIONS AND FEES AS SET FORTH IN THE PROSPECTUS OF THE SELECTED
								FUND. <br> 10. Confidentiality. The Fund and BNY Mellon may record and save any of your
								communications via the On-line Services, just as they may record and save telephone
								conversations. The Fund and BNY Mellon shall treat as confidential all such
								communications; except to the extent required by law or by order or requirement of any
								court or governmental authority. On-line Services are the proprietary property of the
								Fund and/or third parties. I will keep confidential and not re-disseminate the
								information or services provided through the On-line Services. <br> 11. Indemnification.
								I agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Fund, BNY Mellon and any other Fund agents
								from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including but not
								limited to attorneys' fees) arising from any violation of this Agreement, state or
								federal securities laws or regulations, or any third party's rights, including but not
								limited to copyright, proprietary and privacy rights. <br> 12. Personal Financial
								Information. Use of the On-line Services may involve the transmission from or to me of
								personal financial information (such as the amount and price of securities that I buy or
								sell). I consent to the transmission of that information through the On-line Services at
								all times that I use the On-line Services. <br> 13. Severability. If a court, regulatory
								agency or body holds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, such
								invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to that provision. The validity of the
								remaining provisions will not be affected. <br> 14. Discontinuance of On-line Services.
								The Fund may discontinue or modify the terms of the On-line Services in whole or in part
								at any time or from time to time and may deactivate my user ID, passwords, security
								code(s) and other security information if it believes that I have violated the terms and
								conditions hereof or have used the On-line Services in a manner inconsistent with these
								terms and conditions. <br> 15. On-line Services Software License. My use of any On-line
								Services software is subject to the terms of the following License ("License"). I agree
								to be bound by the terms of this License, including without limitation the prohibitions
								on distribution and copying, the exclusion of all representations and warranties, and
								the limitation of remedies to the replacement of defective disks. <br> a. Grant of
								License. This License permits me to access the On-line Services software ("Application")
								from each computer in my household, and a single computer at my workplace, in the United
								States. This License is subject to my compliance with the terms of this Agreement and
								the Fund security procedures established for Application users. This Agreement is my
								proof of license to exercise the rights granted herein and must be retained by me. I may
								not rent, lease or transfer my rights to access the Application. <br> b.Copyright. The
								Application is owned by the Fund or its suppliers and is protected by United States
								copyright laws and international treaty provisions. Therefore, I must treat the
								Application like any other copyrighted material (e.g., a book or musical recording)
								except that I may either (a) copy or download information solely for backup or archival
								purposes, or (b) transfer the information to a single hard disk provided I keep the
								original solely for backup or archival purposes. I may not distribute the on-line
								contents in any way, without explicit written notice from the Fund. <br> c. Restricted
								Rights. I may not redistribute, sell, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or
								otherwise reduce the Application to any other form whatsoever. <br> 16. No Warranty. I
								expressly agree that the use of the On-line Services, including the transmission and
								storage of any information through such use of the On-line Services, is at my sole risk
								and responsibility. NEITHER THE FUND NOR ANY THIRD PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
								WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
								MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO
								THE ON-LINE SERVICES, THE APPLICATION, ANY ACCOMPANYING ON-LINE MATERIALS, OR ANY
								INFORMATION PROGRAMS OR PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM, THROUGH, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF
								THE FOREGOING. IN NO EVENT WILL THE FUND OR ANY THIRD PARTY BE LIABLE FOR, INCLUDING,
								WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
								PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF INFORMATION, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
								COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, SPECIAL DAMAGES OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS ARISING OUT OF
								OR RESULTING FROM ANY DEFECT IN, INABILITY TO ACCESS, OR USE OF THE ON-LINE SERVICES OR
								THE APPLICATION, EVEN IF THE FUND OR ANY THIRD PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
								OF SUCH DAMAGES AND WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY,
								NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, MISREPRESENTATION, CLAIMS FOR FAILURE TO EXERCISE DUE CARE
								IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES OR OTHERWISE. I AGREE THAT THE USE OF THE ON-LINE
								SERVICES IS AT MY RISK AND THE ON-LINE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS". THE FUND TAKES ALL
								REASONABLE MEASURES TO ENSURE THE SITE, THE MATERIAL ON THE SITE AND THE ON-LINE
								SERVICES ARE AS ACCURATE AND TIMELY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT DISRUPTIONS OF SERVICE ARE
								MINIMAL. BUT THE FUND MAKES NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE CONCERNING THE UNINTERRUPTED
								AVAILABILITY OF THE ON-LINE SERVICES, INCLUDING THIS SITE OR THE SERVICES OR INFORMATION
								ON IT. PARTICIPATING IN THE ON-LINE SERVICES INVOLVES SENDING AND RECEIVING PERSONAL
								FINANCIAL INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET, AND POTENTIALLY OTHER ELECTRONIC NETWORKS AND
								THERE MAY BE CERTAIN ASSOCIATED RISKS. ON RARE OCCASIONS PROBLEMS MAY ARISE, SUCH AS
								EMAILS FAILING TO TRANSMIT, LINKS FAILING TO FUNCTION PROPERLY OR A SYSTEM FAILURE AT MY
								ON-LINE SERVICE PROVIDER. I AM COMFORTABLE WITH THE EFFORTS OF THE FUND TO SAFEGUARD MY
								ACCOUNT INFORMATION. HOWEVER, I UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN WITH THE SECURITY THE FUND HAS IN
								PLACE, THE FUND CANNOT GUARANTEE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF ANY INFORMATION TRANSMITTED OVER
								THE INTERNET OR OTHER ELECTRONIC NETWORKS. I ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK RELATED TO MY
								PARTICIPATION IN THE ON-LINE SERVICES. <br> Because some states do not allow the
								exclusion or limitation of warranties or of liability for consequential or incidental
								damages, the above limitation may not apply to me. No oral advice or written information
								given by the Fund or any of its employees or agents will create a warranty, and I will
								not rely on any such information or advice. The Fund does not warrant that the On-line
								Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that
								the Website or the server that makes it available are free of viruses or other harmful
								components. I understand that an undetected or unrepaired virus may corrupt and destroy
								my programs, files and hardware, and that the virus may be unintentionally transmitted
								to other computers. <br> 17. Assignment. I may not assign this Agreement or any rights
								or obligations hereunder without the consent of the Fund. The Fund may assign this
								Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without notice to me.
								<br> 18. Notices. All notices to the Fund under this Agreement will be directed to:
								For 529 Accounts: <br>
								BlackRock Funds <br>
								PO Box 534433 <br>
								Pittsburgh, PA 15253-4433 <br>

							</p>
							<p>19. Termination; Amendment; No Waiver. The Fund may terminate this Agreement or amend it
								in whole or in part by notice to me. This Agreement may not be amended in any other
								manner. The failure or delay of the Fund to enforce any provision of this Agreement will
								not be construed as a waiver of such provision. I may terminate this Agreement by
								notifying the Fund in writing. This Agreement will also terminate if I fail to comply
								with any condition of this Agreement, and I agree that upon such termination I shall
								halt access to the On-Line Services, the Application and all on-line documentation. <br>
								20. Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware
								except for conflict of law provisions. Captions in this Agreement are included for
								convenience of reference only and do not effect the construction or effect of the
								provisions of this Agreement. <br> 21. No Bank Guarantee. I understand that shares of
								the Fund are not bank deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed, endorsed or otherwise
								supported by any Bank or affiliate, and are not federally insured or guaranteed by the
								U.S. government, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Reserve Board, or any
								other governmental agency. <br> 22. Other. This agreement, and any agreements or
								documents incorporated herein, are the sole and complete agreements of the parties with
								respect to its subject matter. The Fund shall not have any responsibility or liability
								for its delay or failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable control and the
								time for such performance shall be extended by the time of such delay. <br> 23. No fees
								for site use. The Fund does not charge any fees for participating in the On-line
								Services, but I may incur Internet access or other related charges from third parties,
								such as my electronic service provider. <br> 24. Authority to accept this Agreement. I
								agree, represent and warrant that I have full authority to accept this Agreement.</p>
							<p>I understand that accessing and/ or processing transactions through the On-line Services
								constitutes my consent to the terms of this Agreement. I have read and agree to the
								terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p>
